	* Makefile.am: add support for gtk glade files and resources.

	* DebugAttributes.cs: change the pixbuf object source to
	GtkVisualizers.PixbufObjectSource from VisualizerObjectSource.

	* gtk/PixbufVisualizer.cs (PixbufWindow): new class to wrap the
	glade UI.
	(PixbufVisualizer): read the data as written by our custom
	objectsource.
	(PixbufObjectSource): new class, since Pixbufs aren't
	serializable, we have to write the data ourselves.
